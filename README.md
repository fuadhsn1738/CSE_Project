 Hospital management system

This is a project about managing a patient's file in a hospital.
users are required to login and give a password in order to reach the menu.
Consult "user info.txt" to see the username and password.
the user will then be given 4 options in which they have to pick by inputting the number and the action corresponding to the number will commence.
For example: users can create a user file, read an already existing file or discharge a patient.
